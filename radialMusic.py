"""
This is a script that will hopefully eventually be fleshed into something 
that can convert an image into sound. Currently, it will only take in a Polar coordinate function,
and convert it into a number.

Hopeful final program flow:
	Read image
	Convert to function
	Convert Function to number
	Convert number to sound

This script will at first only cover the conversion of Function to number
